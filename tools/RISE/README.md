## Method overview
To generate a saliency map for model's prediction, RISE queries black-box model on multiple randomly masked versions of input.
After all the queries are done we average all the masks with respect to their scores to produce the final saliency map. The idea behind this is that whenever a mask preserves important parts of the image it gets higher score, and consequently has a higher weight in the sum.

## Repository contents
* The whole idea is implemented in [Easy_start](Easy_start.ipynb) notebook, it's done in Keras but is really easy to modify for any framework, since the method itself is model-agnostic.
* [Saliency](Saliency.ipynb) notebook demonstrates the usage of RISE class optimized for PyTorch.
* [Evaluation](Evaluation.ipynb) notebook displays another contribution of the paper: *Causal metrics*.
